        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Peel 1 onion, place in a food processor with the mushrooms, rye bread and 1 teaspoon of ground coriander, and whiz until fine. Drain and pulse in the black beans, season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, then divide into 4 and shape into patties, roughly 2.5cm thick. Rub all over with oil and dust with ground coriander, then place on an oiled baking tray and roast for 25 minutes, or until dark and crispy, topping with the Cheddar and warming the rolls for the last few minutes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Meanwhile, peel and very finely chop the remaining onion with the tomatoes and place in a bowl. Squeeze over the lime juice, add a few shakes of Tabasco and season to taste. Destone, peel and finely slice the mango and avocado. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Halve the warm rolls and divide the yoghurt between the bases, followed by half the salsa, the mango, avocado and coriander leaves. Top with the burgers, remaining salsa and extra Tabasco, pop the lids on and press down lightly. </p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Soft-boil 4 eggs in a pan of boiling salted water on a medium high heat for 5 minutes exactly, then drain, cool under cold running water, and peel. Tip the grains into a food processor with the curry paste, pick in the mint leaves, then whiz until fairly fine and tacky in texture, adding a splash of water, if needed. Divide into 4 balls. One at a time, pat out on a 15cm square of greaseproof paper, to just under 1cm thick. Place the paper flat on your hand, put a peeled egg in the centre and mould the mixture up and around the egg to seal it inside, using the paper to help you. As it comes together into a ball, remove it from the paper and press gently in your hands to create the perfect covering – patch up any holes as you go. Place the flour in one bowl, beat the remaining egg in another, then whiz the naan to fine crumbs and tip into a third bowl. Cover the coated eggs with flour, dip into the beaten egg and roll in the crumbs until well covered, then chill.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’re ready to cook, just under half-fill a large sturdy pan with oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium-high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go. Carefully lower the Scotch eggs into the pan using a slotted spoon and cook for 8 minutes, or until golden. Scoop out and drain on kitchen paper. Cut in half and serve seasoned lightly with sea salt and with mango chutney for dunking.</p>

            </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Scrub the carrots, then cook in a pan of fast-boiling salted water for 10 minutes, or until just tender, then drain. Finely grate half the orange zest into the empty pan and squeeze in all the juice. Place on a medium heat, add the bay, thyme and a good pinch of sea salt, then cook until syrupy, folding the carrots back into the glaze to coat. Leave to cool.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> One by one, lay out the filo sheets, rub with oil, then cut lengthways into 3 strips. Place a carrot at the bottom of each and roll up like a cigar, squeezing lightly to seal (don’t worry about being too neat). Repeat with the remaining carrots and filo, placing them on a baking tray as you go. Brush each lightly with oil, then roast for 20 minutes, or until lightly golden and crisp, drizzling with a little honey and scattering with the sesame seeds for the last 5 minutes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Stack the carrots on a board, scattering over any sesame seeds left on the tray, then swirl the tahini and harissa through the yoghurt and serve alongside.</p>
